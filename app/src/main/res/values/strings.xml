African Refugee Development Center
The African Refugee Development Center is a grassroots, community-based nonprofit organization
        that was founded in 2004 by African asylum-seekers and Israeli citizens in order
        to protect, assist, and empower African refugees and asylum-seekers in Israel. ARDC began
        its work as a humanitarian aid organization, and over time has adapted to fit community
        needs. Currently, ARDC works to address gaps in services created by harsh governmental policies in 4 key sectors: education, livelihoods, advocacy, and rights empowerment. To date, ARDC has served over 15,000 asylum-seekers from a number of countries and operates various educational programs seeking to deepen
        the social and economic inclusion of asylum-seekers throughout Israel.</string>
